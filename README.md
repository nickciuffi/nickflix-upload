# Nickflix
<br>
This project is a Web Application that simulates a complete streaming App.<br>
In this Repo, you can access the local part of the project, responsible for the movie and subtitle file uploads.<br>
I first tried to do the upload in laravel, but it was taking too much time, and it made the user experience very poor, so I decided to give Golang a go, as I already wanted to try this awesome language.<br>
As it is my first Golang application, I only used the simple parts of the language, so I believe there are lots of performance improvements to be made in this project.<br><br>

# Tech stack:
<br>
In this part of the project I only used the Golang, with a few libraries, that I found in the official documentation.<br><br>

# Conclusion
<br>
Creating my first Go project was an awesome experience, so I plan on learning a lot more about the language.<br><br>

Ps: This project was build exclusivelly for learning purposes, so it is clear that only testing videos were used in this project.
